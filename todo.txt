## Current
-completed character information (at least 100% of info on default pathfinder character sheet)

#bugs

-on refresh, pages (game maybe others) sometimes ask if I want to resubmit data
-after creating a game you should be brough to the game page
-slugs need to be forced to be unique https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions/blob/master/django_extensions/db/fields/__init__.py#L29
-base attack bonus (bab) model field needs to be able to save multiple integers. No idea how to do this.

#features

-add avatars for characters
-add images for games
-way to search characters and add them to your game that makes more sense than a drop down
-way to add weapons and equipment to a character. Way to equip and de-equip.
-way to trade equipment between characters in a game

#refactor (in the long distant future of maybe never)

-abstract out to class based views
-specify custom user model
-abstract character model skills and abilities (at least) into abstract, subclassed models of their own

#consider

-replace "game" with "campaign" recursively everywhere and then deal with the problems

##### character model logic
#### skills
if <skill_class> == yes -> +3
if <skill_rank> <= level -> allow ranks to increase
