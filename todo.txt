#bugs

-on refresh, pages (game maybe others) sometimes ask if I want to resubmit data

#features

-make view for players (games they GM, characters they own)
-edit characters you own
-tabbed, ajaxy character pages
-add avatars for characters
-add images for games
-footer general list needs to actually sort by recent / models need to know what recent means

#consider

-replace "game" with "campaign" recursively everywhere and then deal with the problems
