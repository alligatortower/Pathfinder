#bugs

-on refresh, pages (game maybe others) sometimes ask if I want to resubmit data
-after creating a game you should be brough to the game page

#features

-better tabs
-completed character information (at least 100% of info on default pathfinder character sheet)
-edit characters you own
-ajaxy character pages
-add avatars for characters
-add images for games

#refactor (in the long distant future of maybe never)

-abstract out to class based views
-specify custom user model


#consider

-replace "game" with "campaign" recursively everywhere and then deal with the problems
